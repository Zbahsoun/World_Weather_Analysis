# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of the project

The purpose of this project was to create a large list of global locations using the latitude and longitude numbers to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels for the app users. 

After pulling this data, we used the Open Weather Map API to display the weather information, and the Google Maps API to identify the nearest hotels in the cities that match the user's specifications in terms of maximum and minimum temperature. 

The below map shows the result of our project.
